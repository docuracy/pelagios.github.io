Mapping the Transport Network of England & Wales, 1530-1680.

This project, led by Dr Stephen Gadd and Colin Greenstreet, aims to record the condition and development of highways (both roads and navigable waterways) in England and Wales between 1530 and 1680, the period during which began the network’s transformation from one serving primarily local agricultural markets to one fit for an emerging industrial economy. Rather than identifying wholly new infrastructure, we hope to discover when and where network stresses occurred and were remedied, and when particular highway sections became identified as ‘principal routes’. Such analysis will help to identify the geographic scope and scale of industrial development and decline.
